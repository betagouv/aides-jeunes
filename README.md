# Front only install

If you want to play with the UI, you can be set up very quickly:

```bash
npm ci
npm run front
```

Cf. `package.json` for more on the underlying commands.

The application should be accessible at `localhost:8080`.

# Full install

## System dependencies

### Ubuntu

Make sure `build-essential`, `mongodb` and `node` 18.x are installed on your machine:

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install mongodb
```

### For all platforms

The runtime is Node 18.x for the web application, and Python >= 3.9 for Openfisca.

You can for example use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install this specific version.

You will need [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/) to install Openfisca.

## Application

Run the following from the root of the project to install the dependencies

```sh
npm ci
```

## Openfisca

There are 2 ways to run Openfisca:

- either by installing its dependencies in a Python virual environment locally on your machine
- or by using Docker to pull and build an image with the required dependencies

### Install Openfisca in a virtual environment

You should [install Python 3 in a virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to prevent yourself from messing with your main python installation. The instructions below rely on the built-in `venv` module so that there are no additional external dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv   # create the virtual environment in the .venv folder
source .venv/bin/activate  # activate the virtual environment
pip install pip --upgrade  # make sure we're using the latest pip version
npm run install-openfisca  # install dependencies
```

Then, to start the OpenFisca server, simply run `source .venv/bin/activate` followed by `npm run openfisca`.

OpenFisca dependencies are specified in [openfisca/requirements.txt](https://github.com/betagouv/aides-jeunes/blob/main/openfisca/requirements.txt), a basic [Python requirements file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#example-requirements-file). It is possible to refer to non-production commit hashs but is prefered to use _main-merged_ commits.

### Install and run Openfisca in a docker container

If you want to run Openfisca without having to install a specific version of Python or create a virtual environment you can use the docker file provided to run Openfisca in a container. From the root of the project run the following command to build the docker image:

```bash
docker build -f openfisca/Dockerfile ./openfisca -t openfisca
```

### Development mode

If you are working on `openfisca-france` and want to use your local version:

```
cd (...)/openfisca-france
pip install --editable .
```

## Test in production mode

If you want to test locally the app in production mode:

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Usage

First, start a Mongo server:

```sh
npm run db
```

Then, in another shell you will need to start openfisca. If you installed it locally activate the virtual environment (run `source .venv/bin/activate`) and start the Openfisca server:

```sh
OPENFISCA_WORKERS=1 npm run openfisca
```

If instead you want to run Openfisca in a docker container run:

```bash
docker run -d -p 2000:2000 openfisca
```

(note that in that case Openfisca will run in the background and you will have to run `docker ps` and `docker stop XXXXX` where XXXXX is the container ID to stop Openfisca)

Finally, in a third shell, start the server:

```sh
npm run serve
```

# Testing

There are several levels of tests:

- Unit tests are executed by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/fr/) and run with `npm test`.
- End-to-end test are executed with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) with `npm run cypress`

You can safely use `npm test && npm run cypress` to drive your developments.

## Email

We use the framework [MJML](https://mjml.io/) to design and integrate the templates. [Tipimail](https://fr.tipimail.com) is our service to send emails.

The development server for emails can be easily start with: `npm run tools:serve-mail`

If you want to verify the email sending process, you can generate a set of the required `SMTP_*` environment variables by running `ts-node tools/create-temp-smtp-server.ts` to generate a test account on `https://ethereal.email`.

## Linting and format

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as a linter and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the codebase.
We also utilize some ESLint plugins, such as [vue-eslint](https://eslint.vuejs.org/user-guide/) and [eslint-plugin-cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/eslint-plugin-cypress), to provide a support for tests and framework.

# Continuous deployment

SSHs keys were generated to [run scripts](http://man.openbsd.org/sshd#command=%22command%22) on the production server.

The `main` and `dev` branches are automatically deployed on the production server when they are updated using a [continuous deployment script](https://github.com/betagouv/aides-jeunes/actions/workflows/cd.yml).

Note that it is also possible to re-trigger a deployment manually by clicking on `Run workflow` button on the [continuous deployment's page](https://github.com/betagouv/aides-jeunes/actions/workflows/cd.yml) and selecting either the `main` or `dev` branch.

To access the applications server it is possible to connect to it with a registered public key using ssh:

```sh
ssh debian@equinoxe.mes-aides.1jeune1solution.beta.gouv.fr
```

# Other tools scripts & tips

In order to use those tools you need to build the server at least once using the command `npm run build:server`.

- `npm run husky` installs git hooks used to facilitate development and reduce the CI running time.

- `npm run tools:check-links-validity` validates links to 3rd parties in benefits files.

- `npm run tools:cleaner` cleans simulations data older than 31 days.

- `npm run tools:evaluate-benefits <simulationId>` evaluates benefits linked to a simulation id.

- `npm run tools:generate-missing-institutions-aides-velo` generates missing institutions for the package `aides-velo`.

- `npm run tools:geographical-benefits-details` gets the relevant benefits for each commune.

- `npm run tools:get-all-steps` gets all the steps and substeps of a simulation.

- `npm run tools:serve-mail` generates emails which contain the result of a simulation or a survey.

- `npm run tools:test-benefits-geographical-constraint-consistency` validates geographical constraint consistency of benefits.

- `npm run tools:test-definition-periods`validates the periods of openfisca requested variables.

- [Locally](http://localhost:8080/simulation/resultats?debug) or on [production](https://mes-aides.1jeune1solution.beta.gouv.fr/simulation/resultats?debug), it is possible to visualize all the available benefits of the simulator. It is done by adding `debug` as a parameter. It is also possible to set `debug=ppa,rsa` to choose which benefits are listed.

- Adding `debug=parcours` as a parameter, show a debug version of all the steps in the simulator, [locally](https://localhost:8080/simulation/individu/demandeur/date_naissance?debug=parcours) and [production](https://mes-aides.1jeune1solution.beta.gouv.fr/simulation/individu/demandeur/date_naissance?debug=parcours).

- [OpenFisca tracer](https://openfisca.github.io/tracer/) allows you to debug OpenFisca computations. ([source](https://github.com/openfisca/tracer))

# Export simulations data from database

It is possible to generate simulation statistics from the database running the commande `npm run tools:generate-mongo-stats`.

This will generate 3 csv files in the `dist/documents` folder:

- `monthly_activite.csv` that lists the number of simulations per activity for each month
- `monthly_age.csv` that lists the number of simulations per age for each month
- `monthly_geo.csv` that lists the number of simulations per epci, departement and regions for each month

## NetlifyCMS development

It is possible to locally debug changes in NetlifyCMS configuration.

- First, [contribuer/public/admin/config.yml#L19](https://github.com/betagouv/aides-jeunes/blob/main/contribuer/public/admin/config.yml#L15) ([`local_backend: true`](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/beta-features/#working-with-a-local-git-repository)) must be uncommented;
- `npx netlify-cms-proxy-server` should be ran from `.` and
- `npm ci` and `npm run dev` should be ran from `contribuer`.
- Netlify CMS should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`

Changes made will be reflected locally instead of generating pull requests in production.
